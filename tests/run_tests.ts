/**
 * The `run_tests.ts` script is intended for custom test execution logic that goes beyond
 * what can be achieved with simple CLI commands. This script could be designed to handle
 * complex scenarios, such as:
 *
 * - Conditional test execution: Running different test suites based on certain criteria,
 *   like environment variables or deployment stages.
 *
 * - Dynamic environment setup: Configuring the environment before test runs, such as
 *   setting up databases, seeding data, or configuring services.
 *
 * - Custom reporting: Integrating with custom reporting tools or generating reports that
 *   are tailored to specific requirements.
 *
 * - Orchestrating test runs: Managing the order and flow of test suites across different
 *   environments, ensuring that dependencies between tests are respected.
 *
 * This script should be used when such complex test execution flows are required.
